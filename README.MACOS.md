I'm not a CMake fan in general, and I don't use the cgcmake stuff, so I'm not touching the CMakeLists.txt here.
If you need to build for Linux or Windows please check the original repository.

If you want to build for Mac, you'll need a moderately recent version of scons.  You may also want to change your
path for different versions of Maya.
